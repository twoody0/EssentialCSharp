Zhou Jing | 20 | 1018 | Change paragraph beginning with "The need to support TAP from the UI is one of the key scenarios that led to TAP’s creation." to "Supporting TAP from the UI is a fundamental scenario that led to the development of TAP. Another common scenario occurs on the server side when a client’s request involves retrieving a large dataset from a database. Given that database queries can be time-consuming, it’s crucial to hangle them efficiently. Instead of creating new threads or using threads from the limited thread pool, it’s advisable to utilize asynchronous programming patterns. These patterns avoid blocking threads while waiting for the database response, especially since the actual query operations are executed on a separate machine (the database server). This approach ensures that server resources are used optimally, allowing threads to manage other tasks rather than being idle during I/O operations."
